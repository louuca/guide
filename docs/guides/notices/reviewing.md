# How to Review notices
Your employee just said they needed to take an inactivity notice! They figured out how to submit one from the other guide and just needs you to review it! Well, don't worry with Tovy activity you will have it reviewed in just a few clicks!
## Getting started

Go to the **activity** tab on your sidebar.

You will land on a page that shows the staff that are active and more!
Press **view notices** on the page.

 Once you land on the page it will show you all the inactivity requests in your group. You can accept or deny them based on what you think (or your group rules) this will show up on the person who requested the inactivity screen once you decide.

 > In this case Horne_t is breaking company rules by going on vacation (joke) so I will press deny.
 > For ItsWHOOOPS inactivity according to company policy we allow testing inactivity so I will press approve.

The person requesting the inactivity will see this on the screen once you approve or deny (depending on which one you do)
