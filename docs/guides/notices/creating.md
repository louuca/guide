# How to Create a Notice
You just realized you are about to go on vacation but you have not informed your group that you need to take some time off!! Well don't worry, Tovy will help you inform your group that you are heading off to vacation and that you will be inactive in a few clicks.
## Getting started

Go to the **activity** tab on your sidebar.

![Activity sidebar](https://images.grplaza.org/staff/07059962b8c3f81d803ba36234906676.png)

You will land on a page that shows the staff that are active and more!
Press **View my notices** on the page.

 Once you land on the page press **create inactivity notice**.

A thing will pop up once you press create and it will let you set the date of your inactivity and the reason. Once you have done all of that press submit and it will be sent for higher ranks to review.

You can view the status of your inactivity request by looking at the same tab and it will say if it is accepted declined or under review.
![Under review](https://images.grplaza.org/staff/0b8e88233a204618af8a497a41441415.png) You can learn about how to accept and decline notices in the other guide about it.

Now that you are done informing the group about your vacation wait for your request to be accepted and go enjoy your vacation (or whatever the inactivity is for)
